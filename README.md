# Cognizant's Artificial Intelligence Job Simulation on Forage

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a job simulation focused on AI for Cognizant's Data Science team, completed on Forage. The project involved conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and Google Colab for one of Cognizantâ€™s technology-led clients, Gala Groceries. Additionally, a Python module was prepared containing code to train a model and output performance metrics for the Machine Learning engineering team. Findings and analysis were communicated in the form of a PowerPoint slide to present the results back to the business.

## Project Structure
- **/data**: Contains datasets used for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- **/src**: Python source code for the custom module used in model training and evaluation.
- **/results**: Output files and visualizations generated during the analysis.
- **/presentation**: PowerPoint slides used for presenting findings and analysis.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Mr-Patil/Cognizant-s-Artificial-Intelligence-Job-Simulation-on-Forage.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory to perform exploratory data analysis and model training.

## Usage
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore the datasets provided in the `/data` directory using the Jupyter notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory. Analyze data distributions, correlations, and other relevant statistics.

2. **Model Training**: Utilize the Python module in the `/src` directory to train machine learning models using the provided datasets. Use the notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory as a reference for model training.

3. **Performance Evaluation**: After training the models, utilize the provided Python module to evaluate model performance and output relevant metrics for analysis.

4. **Communication of Findings**: Use the PowerPoint slides in the `/presentation` directory to present the findings and analysis back to the business stakeholders. Ensure clear and concise communication of insights derived from the data analysis and model training.
